# Small-Object Localization Recovery Status

Last updated: 2026-09-05 CST

## Milestone 0 — Regression baseline

- Added a deterministic 544×448 non-square image generator with a generator-owned 16 px football
  bounding box, green field, white line and white-shoe distractors.
- The fixture fixes a deliberately wrong coarse detection below the football. Its intersection with
  the football is exactly zero, and the legacy `0.02` full-image prompt padding still does not cover
  the target.
- The historical-style refined box also has zero intersection with the target and grows to
  4.6973686 times the coarse-box area, preserving the refiner-drift failure before any recovery
  implementation changes behavior.
- Preserved the current B-Human Sample Test as provisional evidence in
  `fixtures/small-object-localization/bhuman-provisional.json`. It contains no invented Ground
  Truth and explicitly requires human calibration before any real-image accuracy claim.
- Captured the backend projection defect: one coarse detection and one refined detection from the
  same lineage currently produce two Sample Test Results. The target terminal projection count is
  one; implementation is assigned to Milestone 6.

Milestone 0 status: `PASS`.
